    <h3>E-RIHS Knowledge Base</h3>
    <p>
        The E-RIHS Knowledge Base is a repository of information about the E-RIHS infrastructure, services, and resources. 
        It is designed to support the E-RIHS community in sharing and discovering information about the E-RIHS infrastructure, services, and resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Knowledge Base is powered by Cordra, a platform for building and managing digital objects. 
        Cordra is designed to support the creation, management, and sharing of digital objects, and to provide a flexible and extensible platform for building digital repositories.

        <em><strong>Note:</strong> this user interface is primarily intended as an administrative user interface. Several user-friendly tools for end users are expected to be developed in the future, which will make underlying use of this Knowledgebase.</em>
    </p>

        The E-RIHS Knowledge Base is a work in progress, and we welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement.
