# Heritage Science Schema Repository

This repository has been created to host completed heritage science metadata gathering json schema. Work and discussion relating to the development of these schema is being carried out within: [https://github.com/E-RIHS/hs-interoperability](https://github.com/E-RIHS/hs-interoperability)

For each type of schema, such as **Project**, create a section in this README file, as shown for **Project** to provide direct links to the current and developmental versions of each scheme along with a table of recent updates and changes. 

Schema documents should be named using lowercase letters, according to the following naming structure: **name-v0.0.schema.json**. Changes to the first version number are reserverd for major changes that might include breaking changes, the second version number should be used for more minor changes including. 

Note: Versions below 1.0 should be used for the intial development of each schema and therefore all versions changes, below 1.0, can include breaking changes even though the first part of the version number stays at 0. These early versions predate the choice for Cordra as the [https://data.e-rihs.io](central metadata store for E-RIHS) and are not available within this system. Because of this, these schema have been moved to the [https://github.com/E-RIHS/schema/drafts]('drafts') subfolder in GitHub.

GitHub pages have been set up based on the root directory of this repository, this provides a much cleaner URL, but there can be a temporary lag between when new files are added and when the links will work. However, once the files have been added in there is no additional delay.
