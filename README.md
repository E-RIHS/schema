# Heritage Science Schema Repository

This repository has been created to host completed heritage science metadata gathering json schema.

For each type of schema, such as **Project**, create a new folder and then place the actual JSON schema documents in the corresponding folder (**project**) and name them in the form **project_v1.0.0.json**, etc.

Direct links to these schema can then be used in the form of:
* [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E-RIHS/schema/main/project/project_v1.0.0.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E-RIHS/schema/main/project/project_v1.0.0.json)

GitHub pages have also been set up based on the root directory of this repository, this provides a much cleaner URL, but there can be a temporary lag between when new files are added and when the links will work. However, once the files have been added in there is no additional delay. 
* [https://e-rihs.github.io/schema/project/project_v1.0.0.json](https://e-rihs.github.io/schema/project/project_v1.0.0.json)

Work and discussion relating to the development of these schema is being carried out within: https://github.com/E-RIHS/hs-interoperability
