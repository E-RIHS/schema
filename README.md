# schema

This repository has been created to host completed heritage science metadata gathering json schema.

For each type of schema, such as **Project**, create a new folder and then place the actual JSON schema documents in the corespondng folder (**project**) and name them in the form **project_v1.0.0.json**, etc.

Work and discussion relating to the development of these schema is being carried out within: https://github.com/E-RIHS/hs-interoperability
